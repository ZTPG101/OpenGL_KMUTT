## Goals
Create a simple 3D game that has the following features:
- Models loading from file: player’s model, scenes, items, enemies,….
- Player can control the player’s model
- Camera that follows the player’s model
- Collision detection between: player-scene, player-items,…

## Concept
This is a simple 3D boat game in which players control a boat to navigate a scene. It features camera controls that follow the boat and basic collision detection to avoid sailing through obstacle which is the island.
