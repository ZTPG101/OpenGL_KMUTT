## Concept
I'm trying to make a growing fractal tree surrounded by orbiting fireflies

## Main features
**Fractal Tree Generation:** Recursively creates a complex, 3D branching tree structure.
<br>**Animated Growth:** Branches smoothly grow from nothing to full size with staggered delays, then reset for continuous animation.
<br>**Dynamic Fireflies:** A system of glowing fireflies with structured orbits and colors circles the tree trunk.
<br>**OpenGL Rendering:** Uses OpenGL to draw textured tree branches (as scaled cubes) and glowing fireflies (as small cubes).
<br>**Multiple Light Sources:** Includes directional light, a camera-attached spotlight, and point lights from fireflies for dynamic illumination.
<br>**Interactive Camera:** Allows user navigation around the scene.
