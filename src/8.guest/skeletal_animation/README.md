## Goals
Learn about character animation control and how to blend animations into one another.

## Concept
The code implements a state machine for skeletal animation blending, allowing a character to transition smoothly between an idle, dance, and moonwalk animation. User input (keys 1, 2, 3, LEFT, RIGHT) directly controls the character's animation state or triggers a blend between animations, with direct key presses overriding continuous input.
